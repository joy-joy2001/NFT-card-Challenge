## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS


### What I learned

While this project was fun to do, it has taught me a lot. I think the main takeaway from this project is the fact that there are some major gaps in my knowledge; I'm still lacking a strong foundation in CSS and HTML. I beginning to appreciate CSS a lot more. It is such a powerful tool that allows beautiful websites. Over the weekend, I was introduced to the world of CSS art and I was absolutely dumbfounded. The way people are using logic such as CSS to create art is absolutely fascinating and it has inspired me to improve my CSS skills. I would love the opportunity to make beautiful websites and art through CSS!

I believe that this website could have built in a more efficient and concise way but that was the whole point of this project! I now know what I need to improve and I am looking forward to use the new things that I have learnt in the next project. Speaking of which, I now understand the hype aroung version control, git, github and the lot. It's a very useful tool and as you can see, this is the first time that I've used it. I'm still getting the hang of it but with a more projects, I'm sure that I will get there üòÅ


### Continued development

CSS Flexbox, grid and all that shizz... Those are things that I definitely need to look over! üòâüòâüòâ
Once I'm more knowledgeable and after a few more projects, I think I'll revisit this project and re-write it to see if I can write it in a clearer and conciser way!!
